Notes I made from following Google's Python class at [https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction).

## Notes
Python does not have type declarations of variables, parameters, functions or methods. As a result, there's no compile-time type checking. There's also no semicolons. The end of a line is the end of a statement. Python source files use the `.py` extension and are called `modules.` To run a module, type `python <module_name>.py <parameters>`. Instead of using curly braces, blocks of code are written by using indentation. Python is case sensitive so "a" and "A" are different variables

## Examples
Setting a variable ex: a = 1 (int object)

String ex: a = 'hi' (str object)

Length of a string (str) ex: len(a)

Converting int object to str: str(intObject)

Comment using #

Repeat a character using * ex: '-' * 2 = '--'
