# Coding-Problems
A repository used for development of coding ability. Currently, this is mainly being used to improve my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, Java, and Python. The bulk of this repository is contained in the README files in each folder.

## Folder Structure
Each folder listed below contains source files and a README with many notes on the respective topic.

* `ds-algo` - Contains coding problems involving data structures and algorithms
* `java` - Contains common usages of Java
* `python` - Contains sample code and notes made from learning Python

## Usage
### Python
1. Open up a terminal such as iTerm 2
2. Change directory to `...\Coding-Problems\python\...`
3. Run a module that has a main function by typing `python <module_filename>`

`It's so easy, right? This is one of the reasons why I love Python.`

### Java
1. In IntelliJ IDEA, click `Import Project` and select the downloaded `Coding-Problems` folder
2. Select `Create project from existing sources`
3. Keep pressing next until you get to the `Please select project SDK` screen at which you will select 1.8 and then press next again
4. Click `Edit Configurations` using the drop-down box
5. Add a new configuration for an `Application`
6. Select a source file with a main method for your `Main class`
7. Press ok  and then click the green triangle button to run the main function of the selected source file
